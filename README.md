  What is all about?

LocalMusicApp - it's a test task that I complete for <img src="https://planx.one/planx.svg" width="35">

The main requirement for the successful finishing of the task was completion it without using database as CoreData/Realm, so that's why music files are stored at project files.

There's some special things about it:
- Background color changes in dependency with whole color of song cover
- You can listen music ðŸŽ¸ in background or with locked screen
- You can change tracks with help of native Control Center
- It's my first app where I worked with music in Swift
- Planning to add: CoreData, language localization, Equalizer, Favourite Songs and etc.
- Planning to improve: code, animations, update UI, GCD & Memory management
